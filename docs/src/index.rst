Scatterkit Documentation
========================

This documentation covers everything you need to know about Scatterkit, the Molecular
Analysis for Interfacial and Confined Systems toolkit. There are five sections:

- :ref:`userdoc-get-started`
- :ref:`userdoc-how-to`
- :ref:`userdoc-analysis-modules`
- :ref:`userdoc_api-documentation`
- :ref:`userdoc-concepts-explanations`

If you are new to Scatterkit, we recommend starting with the :ref:`userdoc-get-started`
section.

Getting started
---------------
The :ref:`userdoc-get-started` section is for Scatterkit beginners. It will help you install
and familiarize yourself with Scatterkit and its approach to analyse molecular dynamics
simulations.

How-to guides
-------------
The :ref:`userdoc-how-to` section is for Scatterkit intermediate and advanced users. It
contains guides taking you through series of steps involved in addressing key problems
and special use-cases in Scatterkit.

Analysis Modules
----------------
The :ref:`userdoc-analysis-modules` section is for Scatterkit for intermediate users, it
contains technical references and parameter list for each Scatterkit module. Even more
advanced API documentation of all underlying *functions* and *classes* is described in
:ref:`userdoc_api-documentation`.

API Documentation
-----------------
The :ref:`userdoc_api-documentation` section is for Scatterkit for advanced users, it
contains technical references and parameter list for the APIs behind the library. It
describes the various functionalities provided by Scatterkit. You can always refer to this
section to learn more about classes, functions, modules, and other aspects of Scatterkit
machinery you may come across behind the analysis classes described in
:ref:`userdoc-analysis-modules`.

Concepts & Explanations
-----------------------
The :ref:`userdoc-concepts-explanations` section discusses key topics and concepts at a
fairly high level and provides explanations to expand your knowledge of Scatterkit. It
requires at least basic to intermediate knowledge of Scatterkit.
