Analysis modules
################

This is a list of all analysis modules provided by MAICoS. Note that we do not have an
example section for each module. Instead, we refer to :ref:`userdoc-how-to`.
Once you understand the basic structure taught there, you can
work with all modules. If not, feel free to raise an issue in GitHub_ or ask us on
Discord_.
