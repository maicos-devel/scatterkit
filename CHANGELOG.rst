CHANGELOG file
--------------

..
  The rules for scatterkit's CHANGELOG file:
  - entries are sorted newest-first.
  - summarize sets of changes (don't reproduce every git log comment here).
  - don't ever delete anything.
  - keep the format consistent (79 char width, Y/M/D date format) and do not
    use tabs but use spaces for formatting
