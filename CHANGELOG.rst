CHANGELOG file
--------------

The rules for scatterkit's CHANGELOG file:

- entries are sorted newest-first.
- summarize sets of changes (don't reproduce every git log comment here).
- don't ever delete anything.
- keep the format consistent (79 char width, Y/M/D date format) and do not
  use tabs but use spaces for formatting
