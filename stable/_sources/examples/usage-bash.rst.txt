Usage - command line
====================

Scatterkit can be used directly from the command line (cli). Using cli instead
of a Jupyter notebook can sometimes be more comfortable, particularly for
lengthy analysis. The cli in particular is handy because it allows for
updating the analysis results during the run. You can specify the number of
frames after the output is updated with the ``-concfreq`` flag. See below for
details.

Note that in this documentation, we almost exclusively describe the use of scatterkit from
the python interpreter, but all operations can be equivalently performed from the cli.

The SAXS profile has been written in a file named ``sq.dat`` in the current
directory. The written file starts with the following lines

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 22-23

.. code-block:: Bash

    head -n 20 sq.dat

For lengthy analysis, use the ``concfreq`` option to update the result during the run
