=============

Like a cooking recipe, How-to guides help you solve key problems and use cases. If you
are a total MAICoS beginner, you should start with the :ref:`userdoc-get-started`
section. Otherwise this section consists of introductory examples and examples
demonstrating specific features of MAICoS' using its Python API.

For running the examples install maicos with the ``examples`` optional dependencies.

.. code-block:: bash
